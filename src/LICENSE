Note well "THE SOFTWARE" refers only to what is running on the client side. It
does not include the backend services, without which HamClock is nearly useless.
Backend services costs me real money but I provide it free of charge for the
benefit of the amateur radio community. Users who build HamClock for their own
personal use are welcome but if you make money from HamClock, please contact
me before proceeding to discuss terms at ecdowney@clearskyinstitute.com.
