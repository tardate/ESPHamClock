# HAM Clock

HamClock is a kiosk-style application that provides real time space weather, radio propagation models, operating events and other information particularly useful to the radio amateur. HamClock was introduced in an
[October 2017 QST article](https://web.archive.org/web/20251130070310/https://clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock/QST-HamClock.pdf).

In early 2026, the community of HamClock enthusiasts was sad to learn that the
creator of [HamClock was now an SK](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/1qqdwln/elwood_downey_wb0oew_creator_of_hamclock_is/)
and that the [HamClock site](https://clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock/) announced:

> HamClock has reached end-of-life, the last release is version 4.22.
> All HamClocks will cease to function in June 2026.
> Thank you for your interest.
> Elwood Downey, WB0OEW, <ecdowney@clearskyinstitute.com>

So what is the future of HamClock?
In the immediate future, HamClock services will start to degrade, as backend dependencies go offline.

The front-end source code is here, but it will really take an effort to re-engineer and re-construct the infrastructure of HamClock to make it a viable ecosystem in the future.

The repository here is currently just an archive of all prior releases of the open-sourced front-end software.
